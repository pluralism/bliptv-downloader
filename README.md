This is a BlipTV downloader. Currently the program can only show to you the download links and it's still very buggy! Keep in mind that this is just a pre alpha release and I'll be updating the program everyday.
For now you can test it by downloading this file: [BlipTV Downloader](https://www.dropbox.com/s/val6mex1jwfhriq/bliptv.exe "Downloader")

Just run it from the command line and the program will show to you the download links!

Update:

* Fixed the size of the video bug

* Fixed a bug! Added new download link for the 32 bit version. 64 bit version will not be updated again because 32 works on both systems.
